              Mrs. Adeyinka's insights on problematic properties saved my
              clients from a disastrous $1.2M investment. They were so grateful

              What makes this challenge different from other real estate
              training programs?

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Unlike generic real estate courses, our challenge focuses
                specifically on high-ticket property sales and the unique
                strategies required to succeed in this lucrative market. We
                bring together six industry experts with specialized knowledge
                in different aspects of premium real estate sales, from property
                evaluation to AI-powered marketing to luxury client psychology.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, our interactive format with daily Q&A sessions
                ensures you get personalized guidance for your specific
                situation, not just theoretical knowledge.

              I'm new to real estate. Is this challenge suitable for beginners?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                While experienced agents will certainly benefit, this challenge
                is specifically designed to help newer agents bypass years of
                trial and error by learning directly from those who have already
                mastered high-ticket sales.
              </p>
              <p>
                In fact, many new agents find it easier to transition directly
                to premium properties rather than trying to "work their way up"
                through lower-priced listings. We'll provide you with the
                mindset, strategies, and scripts you need regardless of your
                experience level.

                The challenge runs for 21 consecutive days from May 18th to June
                7th, 2025. Each day includes:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>A 45-minute expert training session</li>
                <li>A 30-minute Q&A period</li>
                <li>A daily implementation assignment (15-30 minutes)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                All sessions are recorded, so if you miss a live session, you
                can catch up at your convenience. The total time commitment is
                approximately 1.5-2 hours per day.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Yes! You'll receive lifetime access to all training recordings,
                resources, templates, and scripts. This allows you to revisit
                the material whenever you need a refresher or want to implement
                a specific strategy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, you'll maintain access to our private community

                share successes and challenges.

                While results vary based on your market, experience, and
                implementation, past participants have reported:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Closing their first high-ticket property within 90 days of
                  completing the challenge
                </li>
                <li>Increasing their average commission by 200-400%</li>
                <li>
                  Building a network of high-net-worth clients and referral
                  sources
                </li>
                <li>
                  Developing the confidence to pursue premium listings they
                  previously thought were out of reach
                </li>

                The challenge provides you with all the tools, strategies, and

                Your results will depend on how consistently you apply what you
                learn.
